I am a social psychology Ph.D. student at the University of Michigan in Josh Ackerman's [Evolutionary Social Psychology Lab](https://sites.lsa.umich.edu/esplab/). I am interested in our evolved minds and societies.

Please use the tabs above to navigate to my research work.

Along with experience conducting evolutionary psychological research, I have held various paraprofessional academic roles, including as a research assistant, teaching assistant, statistics tutor, writing tutor, proofreader, behavior technician, and a number of student leadership roles.
