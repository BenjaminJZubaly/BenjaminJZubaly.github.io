Originally from North Idaho, I am currently in my fourth year studying psychology and pole vaulting at Trinity Western University (TWU) in British Columbia. I am particularly interested in evolutionary psychology, and I will pursue a PhD in the subject after finishing my undergraduate degree.

During my undergraduate degree I have and will continue to put myself in positions that challenge me and facilitate my professional growth, including as a research assistant, teaching assistant, writing tutor, proofreader, behavior technician, and various student leadership roles. To see my full professional history, check out my CV via the link above.

Current Projects
======
For my senior honours thesis, I am working on a text-analysis study investigating linguistic features of fraudulent scientific papers to make inferences about the psychology of scientific fraud.

As a research assistant in Dr. Jaime Palmer-Hague's Social Neuroendocrinology Laboratory, I am the principle investigator on a project investigating the roles of status, facial cues, and assortative mating as it relates the Trivers-Willard hypothesis in humans.

Working in Dr. Kelly Arbeau's Health Psychology Lab, I am assisting with writing the manuscript for a qualitative study exploring individual's experience of their self during the pandemic.

I will also soon be following up a preliminary study where we tested an adaptive hypothesis of religiosity derived from parasite stress theory. In this study we found that religious behavioral intention to increase in-group embeddedness is predicted by parasite disgust sensitivity. We are interested in whether this relationship is mediated by a preference for monogomy, as would be expected if religiosity adaptively functions to facilitate cultural conditions which benefit a monogomous reproductive strategy.
