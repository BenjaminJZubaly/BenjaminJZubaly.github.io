I am a recent graduate (BA Honours in Psychology) from Trinity Western University (TWU) in British Columbia. I am most interested in our evolved minds—particularly relating to moral and social phenomena—and will pursue a PhD in evolutionary pyschology within the next couple years. This summer, I am conducting research on the intersection of the behavioral immune system and religiosity, facial cues of indirect aggression in women, and parental effects on offspring sex under the support of an Undergraduate Student Research Award from TWU.

I have experience in various paraprofessional roles within the academy, including as a research assistant, teaching assistant, statistics tutor, writing tutor, proofreader, behavior technician, and various student leadership roles. For my full professional history, [check out my CV](/files/CV.pdf). To start in the Fall of 2024, I am looking for a post-bacc research job (e.g., lab manager, research assistant) in order to continue to prepare professionally and financially for graduate school (hire me!).

Current Projects
======
Under the funding of a TWU Undergraduate Student Research Award and the supervision of Dr. Jaime Palmer-Hague and Dr. Kelly Arbeau, I am working on why there is a relationship between disgust and religiosity. Inspired by the behavioral immune system model, we are testing competing predictions about why people who are higher in disgust tend to be more religious.

As a research assistant in Dr. Jaime Palmer-Hague's Social Neuroendocrinology Laboratory, I am finishing up a project investigating potential adaptive effects of parental facial dominance and assortative mating on offspring sex. In addition, we will soon be embarking on a project to better understand the facial cues that are perceived to indicate indirect aggression.

Working in Dr. Kelly Arbeau's Health Psychology Lab, I am assisting with writing the manuscript for a qualitative study exploring individual's experience of their self during the pandemic.

Previous Projects

My undergraduate honours thesis was a text-analysis study investigating linguistic features of fraudulent research papers to make inferences about the psychology of scientific fraud.
